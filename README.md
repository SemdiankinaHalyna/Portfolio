## Projects

  In this project, I analyzed university reviews collected from open sources. I visualized the distribution of ratings to examine tendencies toward positive or negative feedback, performed sentiment analysis using    a BERT model and compared results with star ratings. I ranked universities by sentiment scores, created a heatmap showing sentiment changes over years, and outlined the next step — building a multi-class       classification model to automatically identify key issues in negative reviews.
 
## Micro Projects

In this project, I applied the LightGBM algorithm to build a model for predicting real estate prices. The workflow included comprehensive data preprocessing with feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, training, performance evaluation using appropriate metrics, and model tuning to improve accuracy.
