  In this project, I analyzed university reviews collected from open sources. I visualized the distribution of ratings to examine tendencies toward positive or negative feedback, performed sentiment analysis using    a BERT model and compared results with star ratings. I ranked universities by sentiment scores, created a heatmap showing sentiment changes over years, and outlined the next step — building a multi-class       classification model to automatically identify key issues in negative reviews.
